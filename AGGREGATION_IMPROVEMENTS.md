# Aggregation Logic Improvements

## Overview

This document describes the improvements made to the aggregation logic in `modules/aggregation.py` to fix client-specific data separation issues and enhance the system's ability to handle dynamic question mappings.

## Problems Addressed

### 1. Identical Client Results
- **Issue**: All clients were receiving identical aggregated results instead of client-specific filtered data
- **Root Cause**: The system was using a fixed "base file" approach that caused all clients to reference the same question set
- **Impact**: Client-specific question filtering was not working correctly

### 2. Limited Question Mapping
- **Issue**: System was hardcoded to handle only a fixed number of questions (originally 90)
- **Root Cause**: Static mapping logic that couldn't adapt to varying question counts
- **Impact**: New questions or different question sets would not be processed correctly

### 3. Base File Dependency
- **Issue**: All clients were forced to use the same "base file" for question mapping
- **Root Cause**: Logic selected `file_list[0]` as base file for all clients
- **Impact**: Client-specific question configurations were ignored

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Dynamic Global Question Mapping
```python
# Before: Limited static mapping
# After: Dynamic mapping that auto-detects all questions
global_q_to_text_map = {}
for col in question_master_df.columns:
    if col != '質問文' and col != '初出ファイル' and col.endswith('.xlsx'):
        temp_mapping = question_master_df[['質問文', col]].dropna()
        for _, row in temp_mapping.iterrows():
            if row[col] not in global_q_to_text_map:
                global_q_to_text_map[row[col]] = row['質問文']
```

**Benefits:**
- Automatically detects all available questions from question master
- Scales dynamically with any number of questions (90, 150, 200+)
- No hardcoded limits

### 2. Client-Specific Mapping Generation
```python
# Create client-specific mapping instead of shared base file
for question_text in all_questions:
    matching_rows = question_master_df[question_master_df['質問文'] == question_text]
    if not matching_rows.empty:
        row = matching_rows.iloc[0]
        for col in question_master_df.columns:
            if col.endswith('.xlsx') and pd.notna(row[col]):
                client_mapping_data.append({
                    '質問文': question_text,
                    '質問番号': row[col]
                })
                break
```

**Benefits:**
- Each client gets their own specific question mapping
- Eliminates shared base file dependency
- Ensures true client data separation

### 3. Enhanced Debug Logging
```python
logs.append(f"統合マッピングを作成: {len(global_q_to_text_map)}個の質問コードをテキストにマッピング")
logs.append(f"question_masterから検出された総質問数: {len(question_master_df)}個")
logs.append(f"'{client_name}' - クライアント固有質問: {len(client_unique_questions)}個")
```

**Benefits:**
- Japanese UI for better user experience
- Detailed progress tracking
- Easy debugging of client differences

### 4. Improved Question Filtering Logic
```python
# Enhanced client-specific question selection
for q in all_questions:
    found = False
    columns_for_this_question = []
    
    # Exact match search
    if q in merged_df.columns:
        columns_for_this_question.append(q)
        found = True
    
    # Suffix-based search (e.g., question_1, question_2)
    for col in merged_df.columns:
        if str(col).startswith(q + '_'):
            columns_for_this_question.append(col)
            found = True
    
    if found:
        cols_to_select.extend(columns_for_this_question)
        found_questions.append(q)
```

**Benefits:**
- Handles both exact matches and suffixed variations
- Comprehensive question detection
- Robust column selection logic

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow
1. **Global Mapping Creation**: Auto-detect all questions from question master
2. **File Processing**: Process each uploaded file with dynamic mapping
3. **Client-Specific Filtering**: Filter questions based on client settings
4. **Custom Mapping Generation**: Create client-specific mappings
5. **Data Export**: Generate differentiated client outputs

### Key Components

#### Global Question Mapping
- Automatically scans all `.xlsx` columns in question master
- Creates comprehensive Q-code to question text mapping
- Eliminates hardcoded question limits

#### Client-Specific Processing
- Each client processed independently
- Custom question filtering based on client settings
- Individual mapping generation per client

#### Enhanced Logging
- Japanese UI for better user experience
- Detailed progress tracking
- Debug information for troubleshooting

## Results

### Before Improvements
- All 5 clients received identical results
- Limited to fixed number of questions
- Shared base file caused data duplication
- Poor debugging capabilities

### After Improvements
- Each client receives unique, filtered results
- Dynamic question detection (unlimited)
- Client-specific mappings
- Comprehensive Japanese debug logging
- True data separation achieved

### Performance Impact
- **File Processing**: Improved efficiency with global mapping
- **Memory Usage**: Optimized with client-specific filtering  
- **Scalability**: Now handles any number of questions dynamically
- **Debugging**: Enhanced visibility with detailed logging

## Client Differentiation

The system now properly handles:

**Common Questions (40)**: Demographic data shared across all clients
- Age and gender information
- Geographic location
- Income and education data
- Employment status

**Client-Specific Questions (10 each)**: Industry-specific inquiries
- **AutoMotion Inc**: Vehicle purchase intentions, driving frequency
- **EcoGreen Solutions**: Environmental concerns, energy conservation
- **FitLife Wellness**: Fitness goals, workout preferences  
- **LearnForward Academy**: Learning motivations, educational interests
- **StreamVibe Media**: Entertainment spending, content preferences

## Future Enhancements

1. **Performance Optimization**: Cache global mappings for repeated processing
2. **Validation**: Add data integrity checks for question mappings
3. **Export Options**: Additional output formats (CSV, JSON)
4. **Analytics**: Built-in data analysis and visualization tools
5. **Configuration**: Dynamic client settings management

## Conclusion

These improvements transform the aggregation system from a basic data merger into a sophisticated client-specific data processing engine. The dynamic question mapping and client-specific filtering ensure accurate, differentiated results while maintaining scalability and user-friendly Japanese interface.

The system now properly serves its intended purpose: providing each client with their relevant survey data while maintaining data integrity and processing efficiency.
